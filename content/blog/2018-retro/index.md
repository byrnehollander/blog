I had an exceptional 2018. Liza made us an amazing ‘[modern scrapbook featuring us](https://www.byrneandliza.me)’ cataloguing our time as we settled into post-grad life. I now just want to dump a list of highlights and brief reflections:
* We traveled to FL, Hamptons, Madison, Killington, Peru, Maine, Rhinebeck, and Chicago. I also spent a week in Copenhagen visiting Ginger on her study abroad, adventuring with my mom and Mark, and working from the CPH office for a few days.
* I went to a wild number of live events, and I’m excited that my job is now explicitly focused on helping others discover live events to attend.
* In general, work is going really well. I got into a groove with the platform team (soon to be renamed discovery team), am thinking more about long-term strategy, and I’m incredibly lucky to have such strong relationships with my co-workers (shout out to [Pizza Wednesday](https://wednesday.pizza/), Charlie’s family’s hospitality, Workation, and the nascent #pong community (lol)). Eli and I also went to an [SVPG workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzCYdOaQr1bSVWdHeViOY9SwFEYHFWY9/view?usp=sharing), and I'm optimistic that some of [our takeaways](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18qYkrqMa35UDOdSJMcGo-6ImiuIHXdqMwk6Ztr--6bs/edit?usp=sharing) will change the way we work.
* I won the Sandlot Sports Monday social league dodgeball championship! (And tore a ligament in my pinky along the way.) Ben and I (“Baked Beans”) also arguably won a very casual spikeball tournament.

However, there were a few things that could’ve gone better:
* I re-started work on [Notist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13thSwe4hZesFaFamk5AcS0XcFqQ-2sAx/view?usp=sharing) with Matt, David, and Andrew. We had a hard time building momentum (hard to coordinate schedules, possibly a lack of excitement), though, so we didn’t get too far. I also realized that we need curators / tastemakers to launch any sort of community; so if I try again with this idea, I may build specifically for commentators and those with large email audiences.
* I read less than I wanted. (My next post will be about books I want to read in 2019.) I think this ties into a larger theme in my life: I’ve perpetually had a hard time of forming habits. I also barely exercised and meditated. 
* I’ve also neglected [serious] photography (though I have been using my phone camera a bunch). I’d also like to be more disciplined about organizing/editing my photos, though I’m not sure how I want to share them.
* In a year of Trump and political division, I rarely read the news or engaged politically, and I feel guilty about my apathy. 
* Liza and I dabbled with cooking, but it fizzled out. Similar story with chess.


### Things to prioritize in 2019: 
* Read more consistently, and take better notes on what I read. A couple English professors I worked with in college always stressed the importance of taking notes on what you read for 1. Better understanding and 2. Better reference, and I want to make more of an effort this year.
* Form some other positive habit. I want to go to the gym, play tennis and squash, and meditate, but I also want to be realistic.
* Appreciate music. I put very little thoughts into music this year, opting to just listen to The Mountain Goats on repeat. I want to set aside some time to deeply listen to new albums.
* Organize recurring social plans. I’ve done trivia and board game nights with friends, but they’re always ad-hoc. 
* Go on trips with friends. I didn't hike in 2018, so that's an easy place to start. SeatGeekers have also talked about wanting to go on a trip, and we can easily make it happen.
* Build a small iOS app; I don’t necessarily want to work on Notist or a larger project, but do want to continue building my technical skills

These are all things I hope to someday do, but they aren’t likely to happen this year:

### Not to prioritize in 2019:
* Start a book club 
* Political engagement / following the news
* Cooking
* Video Games
* Appreciating art and going to museums / galleries
* Studying trivia
* Re-invest in photography
* Learning an instrument
* Getting good at chess
* Learning to draw
