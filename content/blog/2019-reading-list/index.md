title: 2019 Reading List
date: '2019-01-03T22:21:45.209Z'
description: 'What I wanted to read in 2019.'
---

I'm not especially optimistic that starting a year with a list is the best approach, but I'm giving it a shot! The sheer number of books is also a bit daunting, and I'd be happy to make it through half the list 😄.

This year, I'm particularly interested in being more critical of what I read and keeping better notes, i.e., maintain what I read rather than just read more. I also thought about themeing the year out (e.g., architecture and urbanism, anarchism and economics), but decided I'd rather have a broad pool of options to choose from.
