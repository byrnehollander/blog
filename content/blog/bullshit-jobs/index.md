*Bullshit Jobs* is about a problem that most people don’t even acknowledge exists — the proliferation of useless jobs (like HR consultants, communications coordinators, PR researchers, financial strategists, etc). The book shatters the idea that capitalism is “efficient."

> A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case

A couple weeks have now passed since I finished this book, and while I highly recommend it, I'm losing my motivation to write an interesting, thought-provoking blog post. Instead, here's a few (very leading) questions I've been thinking about, and ideas I've taken away, and a good mix of quotes:

- If these bullshit jobs do exist, why isn’t their existence acknowledged?
- How can all of our work feel meaningful?
  - "detach livelihood from work" and "establish the right of material existence for all people"
  - Institute UBI and eliminate means testing to reduce paper pushing
    - "leaving it up to each individual to decide whether they wished to pursue further wealth, by doing a paying job, or selling something, or whether they wished to do something else with their time" which "depends on the assumption that human beings don’t have to be compelled to work, or at least, to do something that they feel is useful or beneficial to others."
    - "(Money is after all a rationing ticket, and in an ideal world, one would presumably wish to do as little rationing as possible.)"
- Is Graeber's methodology for unconvering bullshit jobs (Twitter) reasonable?
- How have "managerialist ideologies" impacted our morals?
  - "a deeply held popular feeling that paid employment alone can make one a full moral person, and finally, a fear on the part of the upper classes"
  - One thought from the book: "There was once a time when most students in college whose parents could afford it, or who qualified for scholarships or assistance, received a stipend. It was considered a good thing that there might be a few years in a young man’s or woman’s life where money was not the primary motivation; where he or she could thus be free to pursue other forms of value: say, philosophy, poetry, athletics, sexual experimentation, altered states of consciousness, politics, or the history of Western art. Nowadays it is considered important they should work. However, it is not considered important they should work at anything useful." "In reality, the job just took away time and energy from other activities I had been doing, like campaigning and activism, or reading for pleasure, which I think made me resent it even more."
  - [Pre-industrailization], "the main reason why work could remain so irregular was because it was largely unsupervised."
    - "As a result, over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, starting in England, the old episodic style of working came increasingly to be viewed as a social problem. The middle classes came to see the poor as poor largely because they lacked time discipline; they spent their time recklessly, just as they gambled away their money."
  - "No longer do we hear much about the idle rich—this is not because they don’t exist, but because their idleness is no longer celebrated."
    - "Work, Aristotle insisted, in no sense makes you a better person; in fact, it makes you a worse one, since it takes up so much time, thus making it difficult to fulfill one’s social and political obligations."
    - "we have invented a bizarre sadomasochistic dialectic whereby we feel that pain in the workplace is the only possible justification for our furtive consumer pleasures"
  - "The more the economy becomes a matter of the mere distribution of loot, the more inefficiency and unnecessary chains of command actually make sense, since these are the forms of organization best suited to soaking up as much of that loot as possible."
- Are bullshit jobs actually 50% of jobs in wealthy countries? (Over the course of the last century in wealthy countries, “professional, managerial, clerical, sales, and service workers” tripled, growing “from one-quarter to three-quarters of total employment.”)
  - Do we value low employment to such a degree that we don't object to the growth of pointless employment?
- Do these types of jobs really protect the ruling class?
- Why is it taboo to say your job is pointless or actively bad?
- Do bullshit jobs inflict spiritual violence?
- Are bullshit jobs the reason there hasn't been a massive reduction of working hours in the past fifty years? Are American white collar workers actually spending a huge portion of their time "organizing or attending motivational seminars, updating their Facebook profiles, or downloading TV box sets"?
  - Could we "easily become societies of leisure and institute a twenty-hour workweek"? If yes, what can we do to get there?
- Why is it that "the more obviously one’s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it"?
  - This seems faily easy to observe, but is the following also true?: "the amount of workplace aggression and stress I see in people is inversely correlated with the importance of the work they’re doing... working on meaningful stuff always has more of a collaborative atmosphere, everyone working together toward a greater goal."
- Is finance really _that_ bad?
  - "one could argue that the whole financial sector is a scam of sorts, since it represents itself as largely about directing investments toward profitable opportunities in commerce and industry, when, in fact, it does very little of that. The overwhelming bulk of its profits comes from colluding with government to create, and then to trade and manipulate, various forms of debt."
  - "the most socially valuable workers whose contributions could be calculated are medical researchers, who add $9 of overall value to society for every $1 they are paid. The least valuable were those who worked in the financial sector, who, on average, subtract a net $1.80 in value from society for every $1 of compensation."
- Why does it feel so shitty to pretend to be working? (And why is prentending to be overworked a "reciprocal gesture of appreciation and respect"?)
- How do people justify that bloated bureacracy is preferable to laying those bloated bureaucrats off?
- Why do prisoners prefer to do shit work (like cleaning toilets) to being idle? What does this tell us about society?
- "Groos coined the phrase 'the pleasure at being the cause,' suggesting that it is the basis for play, which he saw as the exercise of powers simply for the sake of exercising them."
  - "human happiness is always caught up in a sense of having effects on the world; a feeling which most people, when they speak of their work, express through a language of social value"
  - "The desire to create art is simply a manifestation of the urge to play as the exercise of freedom for its own sake as well."
- "Being forced to pretend to work just for the sake of working is an indignity, since the demand is perceived—rightly—as the pure exercise of power for its own sake."
- "had the effect of subtly reinforcing the idea that when a worker was 'on the clock,' his time truly did belong to the person who had bought it"
- Are people's social lives worse than ever? ("A common problem in large cities, especially in the North Atlantic world, is that most middle-class people now spend so much time at work that they have few social ties outside it")
- What exactly happened in the eighties? Reagan? "if productivity in a certain enterprise improved, a certain share of the increased profits would be redistributed to the workers in the form of improved wages and benefits. Since the eighties, this is no longer the case."
- Theory of value: "when a good or service answers a demand or otherwise improves people’s lives, then it can be considered genuinely valuable, but when it merely serves to create demand, either by making people feel they are fat and ugly, or luring them into debt and then charging interest, it is not."
- "Capitalism is not a single totalizing system that shapes and embraces every aspect of our existence. It’s not even clear it makes sense to speak of 'capitalism' at all... “capitalism” is a set of abstract ideas that have somehow come to take material form in factories and offices. The world is more complicated and messy than that. Historically, the factories and offices emerged first, long before anyone knew quite what to call them, and to this day, they operate on multiple contradictory logics and purposes."
- "Paradoxically, the more that software engineers collaborate online to do free creative labor simply for the love of doing it, as a gift to humanity, the less incentive they have to make them compatible with other such software, and the more those same engineers will have to be employed in their day jobs fixing the damage—doing"
- "proletariat as a class—a term derived appropriately enough from a Latin word for 'those who produce offspring,' since in Rome, the poorest citizens who did not have enough wealth to tax were useful to the government only by producing sons who could be drafted into the army"
- "the 'source of status,' as Harry Braverman put it, was 'no longer the ability to make things but simply the ability to purchase them'"
- "To be denied work is to be denied far more than the things that work can buy; it is to be denied the ability to define and respect one’s self."
- "Sitting around in cafés all day arguing about politics or gossiping about our friends’ complex polyamorous love affairs takes time (all day, in fact)"
- "Conservative voters, I would suggest, tend to resent intellectuals more than they resent rich people, because they can imagine a scenario in which they or their children might become rich, but cannot possibly imagine one in which they could ever become a member of the cultural elite."
- "sure enough, to be accepted into the Peace Corps, you need to already have a college degree. The US military is a haven for frustrated altruists."
- "as an anarchist, I look forward to seeing states dismantled entirely, and in the meantime, have no interest in policies that will give states more power than they have already."
