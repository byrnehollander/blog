Liza made us an amazing ‘<a href=\"https://www.byrneandliza.me\">modern scrapbook featuring us</a>’ cataloguing our time as we settled into post-grad life. I now just want to dump a list of highlights and brief reflections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We traveled to FL, Hamptons, Madison, Killington, Peru, Maine, Rhinebeck, and Chicago. I also spent a week in Copenhagen visiting Ginger on her study abroad, adventuring with my mom and Mark, and working from the CPH office for a few days.</li>\n<li>I went to a wild number of live events, and I’m excited that my job is now explicitly focused on helping others discover live events to attend.</li>\n<li>In general, work is going really well. I got into a groove with the platform team (soon to be renamed discovery team), am thinking more about long-term strategy, and I’m incredibly lucky to have such strong relationships with my co-workers (shout out to <a href=\"https://wednesday.pizza/\">Pizza Wednesday</a>, Charlie’s family’s hospitality, Workation, and the nascent #pong community (lol)). Eli and I also went to an <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzCYdOaQr1bSVWdHeViOY9SwFEYHFWY9/view?usp=sharing\">SVPG workshop</a>, and I’m optimistic that some of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18qYkrqMa35UDOdSJMcGo-6ImiuIHXdqMwk6Ztr--6bs/edit?usp=sharing\">our takeaways</a> will change the way we work.</li>\n<li>I won the Sandlot Sports Monday social league dodgeball championship! (And tore a ligament in my pinky along the way.) Ben and I (“Baked Beans”) also arguably won a very casual spikeball tournament.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, there were a few things that could’ve gone better:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I re-started work on <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13thSwe4hZesFaFamk5AcS0XcFqQ-2sAx/view?usp=sharing\">Notist</a> with Matt, David, and Andrew. We had a hard time building momentum (hard to coordinate schedules, possibly a lack of excitement), though, so we didn’t get too far. I also realized that we need curators / tastemakers to launch any sort of community; so if I try again with this idea, I may build specifically for commentators and those with large email audiences.</li>\n<li>I read less than I wanted. (My next post will be about books I want to read in 2019.) I think this ties into a larger theme in my life: I’ve perpetually had a hard time of forming habits. I also barely exercised and meditated. </li>\n<li>I’ve also neglected [serious] photography (though I have been using my phone camera a bunch). I’d also like to be more disciplined about organizing/editing my photos, though I’m not sure how I want to share them.</li>\n<li>In a year of Trump and political division, I rarely read the news or engaged politically, and I feel guilty about my apathy. </li>\n<li>Liza and I dabbled with cooking, but it fizzled out. Similar story with chess.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Things to prioritize in 2019:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more consistently, and take better notes on what I read. A couple English professors I worked with in college always stressed the importance of taking notes on what you read for 1. Better understanding and 2. Better reference, and I want to make more of an effort this year.</li>\n<li>Form some other positive habit. I want to go to the gym, play tennis and squash, and meditate, but I also want to be realistic.</li>\n<li>Appreciate music. I put very little thoughts into music this year, opting to just listen to The Mountain Goats on repeat. I want to set aside some time to deeply listen to new albums.</li>\n<li>Organize recurring social plans. I’ve done trivia and board game nights with friends, but they’re always ad-hoc. </li>\n<li>Go on trips with friends. I didn’t hike in 2018, so that’s an easy place to start. SeatGeekers have also talked about wanting to go on a trip, and we can easily make it happen.</li>\n<li>Build a small iOS app; I don’t necessarily want to work on Notist or a larger project, but do want to continue building my technical skills</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all things I hope to someday do, but they aren’t likely to happen this year:</p>\n<h3>Not to prioritize in 2019:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start a book club </li>\n<li>Political engagement / following the news</li>\n<li>Cooking</li>\n<li>Video Games</li>\n<li>Appreciating art and going to museums / galleries</li>\n<li>Studying trivia</li>\n<li>Re-invest in photography</li>\n<li>Learning an instrument</li>\n<li>Getting good at chess</li>\n<li>Learning to draw</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"2018 Retro","date":"January 02, 2019","description":"Some reflection."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-retro/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-reading-list/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2019 Reading List"}}}}}
